# *****Array Practice*****

This project demonstrates how to define and manipulate an array of integers in a programming language. The following steps outline the process:

Steps
Define an Array: Create an array to hold 10 integer values.

Fill the Array: Use a for loop to populate the array with user-defined integers. After populating, utilize a foreach loop to display the elements on the screen.

Add a New Value: Prompt the user to enter a new integer value, which will be added as the 11th element of the array.

Sort and Display: Sort the array in descending order and print the sorted values to the screen.
